# Runge Kutta

A javascript package that can find approximate (numerical) solutions of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using a Runge-Kutta method.

The specific Runge-Kutta method to use is specified by a Butcher Tableau. 
As the package is not restricted to a single Runge-Kutta method, the method used can change adaptively as the solution is evolved.
